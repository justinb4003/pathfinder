# Pathfinder

## Purpose

Playground for visualizing spacecraft trajectories.

## Audience

Currently suitable for small children due to lack of features but intended as
an educational aid in visualizing spacecraft trajectories which tends not to
be a topic for small children.

## Using it

Whatever code is currently in the 'master' branch will be built and published
to https://pathfinder.justinbuist.com. Plug: Azure Static Web Apps an
automatically deploy an Angular app on a Github checkin. It makes hosting
your own Angular app so easy. You don't even need a custom domain to to it, I
just happen to have one that I can point there.

### Dev Environment
If you want to dive in without any local setup StackBlitz can do this: https://stackblitz.com/github/justinb4003/pathfinder

You'll get an in-brower VSCode experience without any fuss.  Also very handy if you don't have the bandwdith to pull down 500MB of node_modules.

If you're used to Angular development it's just a git clone, npm install, and you're ready to go.

# Stock Angular Build instructions below because the Venn diagram of people who want to play with gravitational physics and that know Angular 101 are not overlapping
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
